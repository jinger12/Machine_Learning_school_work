# Machine Learning Work Examples

This is a repository with work examples from school.

The purpose of this is to give prospective employeers an insight concepts and practices I am familiar with.

This is just one part of my portfolio. Please see the other public repositories on my github account for more examples of work I have done. 

Thanks!
